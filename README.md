This repository contains the project for the course Advanced Image Processing (CS754) done by [Pulkit Agarwal](https://github.com/PulkitAgr113) and [Kartik Gokhale](https://github.com/AWorldOfChaos).

The project is based on the paper [Solving Inverse Problems using GAN Priors](https://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/files/papers/ganICASSP18.pdf) by Viraj Shah and Chinmay Hegde. The aim is to compare the proposed PGDGAN algorithm for reconstruction of images with the pre-existing ISTA algorithm based on lasso minimization.
